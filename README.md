## 🧠 Proposed Graph-Based Encryption Algorithm
- Plaintext characters are represented as vertices of a graph  
- Sequential characters are connected to form a cyclic graph  
- Edge weights are calculated using an encoding table and keyword  
- The graph is converted into a **complete weighted graph**
- A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is generated  
- Adjacency matrices and matrix multiplication are used for encryption  
- Decryption is performed using inverse matrices and graph reconstruction  

This approach highlights the use of **graph theory, linear algebra, and algorithms** in secure communication.
